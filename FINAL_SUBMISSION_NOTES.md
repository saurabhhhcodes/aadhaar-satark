# Aadhaar Satark: Final Polish & Winning Features

## 🚀 NEW: Satark AI RAG Agent
A sophisticated AI Assistant is now active in the bottom-right corner. It has "Mastered" the Enrolment, Biometric, and Demographic datasets.

**Try asking these queries during your Demo:**
1.  **Dataset Mastery**: *"How many enrolment records do you have?"* or *"Are you synced with the API?"*
2.  **District Analytics**: *"What is the status of Lucknow?"* or *"Analyze Varanasi"* (It will calculate gaps and suggest 'Mobile Units' if critical).
3.  **Policy Knowledge**: *"What is the penalty for not updating metrics?"* (Retrieves from UIDAI Circular 2026/01).
4.  **Demographics**: *"Show me demographic correction stats."*

## Critical Updates Implemented

1.  **Comprehensive Official Reports (PDF)**:
    *   **Visual Evidence**: Now includes embedded Bar Charts showing Expected vs Actual.

    *   **Official Layout**: Includes "Sign-off" area for authenticity.

2.  **UX Improvements**:
    *   **Auto-Sync**: No more "Grey Window". Data works in the background with a slick Toast notification.
